Example #2 : Working with Stores & Models
===========

This example will show how to:

	- create a two-panel Ext application (using a simple layout)
	- show the evolution of a grid loading data from:

		-> a hard-coded store in the grid definition
		-> creation of a store object
		-> modifying the store to use a model instead of inline field defs
		-> creating a set of buttons that updates the grid with data from:
			. a hard-coded data set
			. pulled from an XML file
			. pulled from the Zend Framework backend (context switching)
