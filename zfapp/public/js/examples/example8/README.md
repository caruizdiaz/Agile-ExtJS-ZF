Example #8 : A More Advanced App - Real-time Chat
===========

This example will show you how to:
	
	- create a more robust application with an Ext JS frontend and ZF backend
	- Use a combination of layouts, stores, forms and a database backend

The sample application lets you:

	- enter in chat messages as username
	- change the username you're posting with
	- shows a list of "Current Users" that have posted messages
	- click on the username to filter the list to ones from just that user
	- includes an auto-refresh on the chat message section to get the latest messages
